The head of the Computer Science department is trying to enforce a new policy for exams. He decided that friends taking the same course should not be allowed to be in the same exam room. He is aware that if all students taking the course are friends, then this means that each student will sit for the exam in a separate room! Therefore, he is quite concerned. He is looking for a way to implement this policy in the most efficient manner. Given N students, each with a set of friends, how should the students be seated such that the number of rooms used is minimized? Assume that the number of available rooms is also N (equal to the number of rooms).There is no known greedy strategy that is guaranteed to find the optimal solution for any instance of the problem described above. However, there are several known greedy strategies that can find solutions that are sometimes optimal and sometimes close to optimal. Your task is to design and implement a greedy algorithm for solving the abovementioned problem. Your algorithm will be tested on a limited number of given instances. For each instance, your algorithm should either find the optimal solution or allocate no more than one room over the number of rooms allocated by the optimal solution.
